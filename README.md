# Cheap Chomps

**Cheap Chomps** is a price-conscious recipe builder designed to help users create delicious, budget-friendly meals using the power of **ChatGPT** and real **ingredient price data**.

> Submitted to **SteelCity Hacks 2023**

Whether you're a broke college student or just tired of overspending on dinner, Cheap Chomps aims to help you whip up affordable recipes based on your budget, preferences, and pantry staples.

## What We Proposed

1. Users input a max budget.
2. ChatGPT generates creative, step-by-step recipes tailored to the input.
3. Ingredient prices are sourced from **Bureau of Labor Statistics** data.
4. Users get recipes with a cost and ingredient breakdown.

## ❗Note on Implementation

Due to limited access to the OpenAI API during the hackathon, we were unable to fully implement the functionality. After exhausting our free OpenAI credits, we pivoted to designing a working prototype and laying out the system architecture and data sources.
