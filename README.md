# Cheap Chomps

Cheap Chomps is a recipe generator designed to help users cook low-cost meals using real-world ingredient price data and the ChatGPT API.

> Submitted to **SteelCity Hacks 2023**

Whether you're a broke college student or just tired of overspending on dinner, Cheap Chomps aims to help you whip up affordable recipes based on your budget.

## What We Proposed

1. Users input a max budget.
2. ChatGPT generates creative, step-by-step recipes tailored to the input.
3. Ingredient prices are sourced from **Bureau of Labor Statistics** data.
4. Users get recipes with a cost and ingredient breakdown.

## ❗Project Status

Due to API token limits during the hackathon, we weren’t able to fully implement backend functionality. After exhausting our GPT quota, we focused on designing the prototype, system flow, and data integration strategy. The project remains incomplete, but we’ve outlined the core components and data pipeline for future development.
